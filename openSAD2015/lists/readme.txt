The original lists in ../rats_sad had some discrepencies with the annotations
available in /scratch2/share/sosXXX/rats_sad 
The lists you see in for_rats only contain the *.flac files for which annotations
were available. 

dev_*.txt contain 159 randomly selected source identities. This number was chosen 
such that the dev to train ratio matches that of the dev-to-train ratio in RATS 
experiments. 
61 alv, 73 eng, and 25 urd. The language distribution matches that of the
original dataset (409/491/170 respectively).
These lists refer to the sad annotation files (dev/train_sad.txt) and the flac files
(train/dev_audio.txt). 
According to the dataset documentation, all the "corrupted" files originate
from here.
